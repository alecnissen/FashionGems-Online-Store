// Components, 
// *** these 3 could be home page, 
// header 
// main section, featured collection, shop now option
// footer, contact, email list etc, 
// *** those will make up the main page, 

// then shopping component, 
// about us/contact us  
// checkout
// pay info 

// header and footer sections stay on the page, even if user goes to different pages, keep that in mind, 

// *** Header Component, 
// title and navbar with links so user can navigate to different pages, 

// ** main component 
// try to print all 20 images to the screen, 

// I printed the 20 items, 
// now I have an img slider up and working, 
// I want to see if I can get rid of the captions, 
// might just place text below it 


// *** PUT HEADER, MAIN AND FOOTER COMPS INTO ONE BIG COMPONENT AND RENDER IT FROM THERE, 

// *** shopping component 

// import axios and render all 20 items on the screen, then we can style them 

// all 20 items rendered, 

// now lets put a card component using bootstrap around each item 

// *** dont forget key elements!!!

// lets fix the quantity buttons
// base style them, so they appear in a row, 
// then we can add the feature when user clicks it will open that products own page, 

// try to get all the cards and buttons to be uniform on the page, 
// try to make all imgs the same size 


// *** base styling on the shopping component is good enought for now, 
// now I will try to implement when user clicks a product, it will load up a specific product page, 
// it loads the img, description, and another way to add item and quantity to cart. 

// now I have figured out a way to display the cicked on product within its own component, 
// now I will commit and save, then begin to append the title, description, price, and all the other details, and apply some base styling. 

// now I will build the about component, 
// before that let me make a home btn, that when pressed routes the user back home,
