<h1>About This Project</h1> 
I created a full stack online E-Commerce website where customers could browse items, view item descriptions, add items to their cart, fill out a delivery and checkout form which is stored in a database and view computed totals for their purchases. This project uses MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, React Router, state management, a third-party API, and a responsive design that looks great on any device.

    <li>Gained more experience using CSS animations to apply fade in effects</li>
    <li>Implemented advanved CSS knowledge by using multiple flexbox containers to create complex designs and layouts</li>
