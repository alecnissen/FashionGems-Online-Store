// Components, 
// *** these 3 could be home page, 
// header 
// main section, featured collection, shop now option
// footer, contact, email list etc, 
// *** those will make up the main page, 

// then shopping component, 
// about us/contact us  
// checkout
// pay info 

// header and footer sections stay on the page, even if user goes to different pages, keep that in mind, 

// *** Header Component, 
// title and navbar with links so user can navigate to different pages, 

// ** main component 
// try to print all 20 images to the screen, 

// I printed the 20 items, 
// now I have an img slider up and working, 
// I want to see if I can get rid of the captions, 
// might just place text below it 


// *** PUT HEADER, MAIN AND FOOTER COMPS INTO ONE BIG COMPONENT AND RENDER IT FROM THERE,
