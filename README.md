<h1>About This Project</h1> 
This was the final project in the React section as part of The Odin Projects course. This was an extremely challenging project, between implementing core react concepts such as state, props and using components, to making sure the user can properly add items to their cart, deleting items, calculating total price. With that being said, I did walk away learning a lot about react and core web development technologies. The overall purpose of the project was to get used to using react router and to build an online shopping store.
